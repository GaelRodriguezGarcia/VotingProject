# VotingProject
This project will require creativity and knowledge of objects. You are going to create a rigged voting machine that wants you to vote for Nixon, if you try to vote for McGovern then something else will happen that wonâ€™t let you vote. vary these events as you go, they should happen in some kind of order not all at once.
